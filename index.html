    <h2 id="title">Welcome to Embody Christ Fellowship</h2>
    Embody is a new church and has found a permanent location not far from you (2014 South Shore Dr.). 
    We are a church where you don’t have to believe to belong. 
    Everyone is at a different place in faith, and we are a fellowship of people who want to seek after 
    the life that Jesus taught about. We don’t have all the answers, but we’ll seek them out together.<br><br>
    
    If you’re looking for an authentic, relevant place to find friendship; and if you want to go deeper 
    as we look at the life and teachings of Jesus...be our guest. We are just like our neighborhood: 
    singles, married, divorced, young, old, alcoholics, soccer moms, Christians, agnostics, atheists, 
    jobless, enthusiastic, depressed... we are regular people, so...no judgment here...just coffee 
    and seeking what God wants to speak into our lives.<br><br>

                Worship doesn't have to be boring. In fact, it is our laidback and creative style of worship 
                that we use to build an atmosphere that welcomes God's presence. At Embody, we want everyone to 
                connect to God in their own personal way.
