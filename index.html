                Are you interested in a place where you can experience honest worship, in a way that engages God's word?<br><br>
                
                Whether you are a believer, or someone just looking to make real connections with real people, you have a home with us!<br><br>
                
                At Embody Christ, our core beliefs are centered on the following three areas:

                <strong>An Authentic Experience.</strong>
                <br>
                Worship doesn't have to be boring.  In fact, it is our laidback and creative style of worship that we use to build an atmosphere that welcomes God's presence. At Embody, we want everyone to connect to God in their own personal way, whether standing or seated. 
                <br>

                <strong>Helping To Grow  Our Community.</strong>
                <br>
                We want to see our community prosper! At Embody, we are focused on our &quot;Prosper Projects&quot; that are geared at serving within our community. We believe God loves our community
                and so do we.  We seek the peace and prosperity of our community so that
                justice, love and mercy reign."

                <strong>Where real life happens together.</strong><br>
                We all have our struggles. At Embody, you don't have to go through them by yourself. Visit our church, and connect to others in a real, authentic way. After all, shouldn't your &quot;home&quot; be where you feel comfortable?
