    Embody meets on Sunday mornings at 10 am. Kids join us for worship then when it’s
    time for the teaching, they head to their own class where they’ll learn in a more kid-
    oriented fashion (which, of course, we hope not to get too far away from as adults).
    We worship in a blended style which means we take some of the thoughtful songs from
    today and mix them with some thoughtful hymns from the past. Art and creativity are
    valued at Embody and we hope to free people to worship and learn in a variety of ways.
