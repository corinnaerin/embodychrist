<h2 id="title">Welcome to Embody Christ Fellowship</h2>
Embody is a new church and has found a permanent location not far from you (2014 South Shore Dr.). 
We are a church where you don't have to believe to belong. 
Everyone is at a different place in faith, and we are a fellowship of people who want to seek after 
the life that Jesus taught about. We don't have all the answers, but we'll seek them out together.<br><br>

If you're looking for an authentic, relevant place to find friendship; and if you want to go deeper 
as we look at the life and teachings of Jesus...be our guest. We are just like our neighborhood: 
singles, married, divorced, young, old, alcoholics, soccer moms, Christians, agnostics, atheists, 
jobless, enthusiastic, depressed... we are regular people, so...no judgment here...just coffee 
and seeking what God wants to speak into our lives.<br><br>

                        Worship doesn't have to be boring. In fact, it is our laidback and creative style of worship 
                        that we use to build an atmosphere that welcomes God's presence. At Embody, we want everyone to 
                        connect to God in their own personal way.

                        We want to see our community prosper! We believe God loves our community 
                        and so do we. We seek the peace and prosperity of our community so that justice, love 
                        and mercy reign.

                        We all have our struggles. At Embody, you don't have to go through them by yourself. 
                        Visit our church, and connect to others in a real, authentic way. After all, shouldn't 
                        your "home" be where you feel comfortable?
